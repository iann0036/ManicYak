<br />
4.3 Fees and Expenses. Client shall be responsible for payment of all costs, fees and expenses assessed by third parties in the course of being provided Services. Such costs include, but are not limited to, the fees required to register and maintain domain names, which is governed by a separate agreement between Client and a third-party domain name registrar.<br />
<br />
4.4 Third-Party Software. Third-party software available through the Services may be governed by separate end user licenses. By using the Services and the third-party software, Client agrees to be bound by the terms of such end user licenses regarding the applicable third-party software. Client consents and authorizes Manic Yak to delegate the authorizations Client provides to Manic Yak to its third party service provider(s) as Manic Yak deems necessary or desirable to provide the applicable Services. Client agrees that the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including any of the other terms, conditions, warranty disclaimers and liability disclaimers incorporated into this Agreement, inure to the benefit of such third party service providers and such third party service providers are deemed to be third party beneficiaries of the Agreement, including any other terms, conditions, warranty disclaimers and liability disclaimers incorporated into this Agreement.

<br />
4.7 Compliance Laws. Client agrees that it will use the Services only for lawful purposes and in accordance with this Agreement.

<br />
4.8 Proprietary Rights. Unless otherwise specified, all work performed hereunder by Manic Yak, is the property of Manic Yak, and all title and interest therein shall vest in Manic Yak. To the extent that title to any such works may not, by operation of law, vest in Manic Yak all rights, title and interest therein are hereby irrevocably assigned to Manic Yak. All such materials shall belong exclusively to Manic Yak, and Manic Yak shall have the right to obtain and to hold in its own name, copyrights, trademarks, registrations, or such other protection as may be appropriate to the subject matter; and any extensions and renewals thereof.

<br />
4.9 Marketing Rights. Client agrees that Manic Yak may refer to Client, or Client's business in Manic Yak marketing materials, the Manic Yak website, and communication to Manic Yak current and prospective clients. Client grants Manic Yak a limited license and permission to use any Client trade name and/or trademark for such, and only for such, purposes.<br />
<br />
5. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, NO OTHER WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER<br />
5.1 Limitation. In the event that any limited guarantees are provided by Manic Yak, such limited guarantees are null and void if Client fails to follow Manic Yak's TOS, AUP and other policies or otherwise breaches this Agreement in any respect.<br />
<br />
5.2 No Other Warranty. Manic Yak does not monitor or exercise control over the content of the information transmitted through its facilities. Use of the Services or any information that may be obtained there from is at Client's own risk. The Services are provided on an "as is" basis, and Client's use of the Services is at its own risk. Except as provided in the order form(s), Manic Yak does not make, and hereby disclaims, any and all other express and/or implied warranties, including, but not limited to, warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement and title, and any warranties arising from a course of dealing, usage, or trade practice. Manic Yak does not represent or warrant that the Services will be uninterrupted, error-free, or completely secure.<br />
<br />
5.3 Disclaimer of Actions Caused by and/or Under the Control of Third Parties. Manic Yak does not and cannot control the flow of information to or from Manic Yak's network and other portions of the Internet. Such flow depends in large part on the performance of the Internet services provided or controlled by third parties. At times, actions or inactions of such third parties may impair or disrupt Client's connections to the Internet (or portions thereof). Manic Yak cannot guarantee that such events will not occur. Accordingly, Manic Yak disclaims any and all liability resulting from or related to such events.<br />
<br />
6. INDEMNIFICATION<br />
Client agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Manic Yak and its affiliates, agents, employees, and licensors (including the third party service providers) harmless from any and all claim, demand, loss, costs or expense, including attorneys' fees, made by any person arising out of Client's violation of this Agreement, State or Federal Securities laws or regulations, or any other person's rights including but not limited to infringement of any copyright or violation of any proprietary or privacy right.<br />
<br />
Under no circumstances, including but not limited to a negligent act, will Manic Yak or its affiliates, agents, employees, or licensors (including third party service providers) be liable for any damages of any kind that result from the use of, or the inability to use, Services, even if any such party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br />
<br />
In no event will Manic Yak or its third party service providers be liable to Client or any third Party for any tort, contract or any other liability arising in connection with the use of the Services, or reliance on any information or services provided by Manic Yak. Manic Yak and its third party service providers will under no circumstances be liable to Client and/or any third party, regardless of the form of action, for any loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses, or any direct, indirect, special, consequential, incidental or punitive damages whatsoever, even if Manic Yak or its third party service providers has been advised of the possibility of such damages, resulting from: (i) the use of the inability to use the Services; (ii) the timeliness, deletion, misdelivery, or failure to store any user date, communications or personalization settings; (iii) the cost of getting substitute goods and services resulting from any products, data, information or services purchases or obtained or messages received or transactions entered into, through or from the Services; (iv) statements or conduct of anyone on the Services; (vi) the use, inability to use, unauthorized use, performance or non-performance of any third party, even if the third party has been advised previously of the possibility of such damages; or (vii) any other matter relating to the Services. Client agrees that Client will not in any way hold Manic Yak responsible for any selection or retention of, or the acts or omissions of, third parties (including third party service providers) in connection with the Client Services.<br />
<br />
Because some states prohibit the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states the limitation of liability only with respect to consequential or incidental damages may not apply to Client, and the respective liability of Manic Yak and its third party service providers, employees, distributors and agents is limited to the greatest extent allowable under applicable law in those states.<br />
<br />
In the event that a court or arbitration panel, as the case may be, should hold that the limitations of liability or remedies available as set forth in this Agreement, or any portions thereof, are unenforceable for any reason, or that any of Client's remedies under this Agreement fail, then Client expressly agrees that under no circumstances will the total, aggregate liability of Manic Yak and its third party service providers, employees, distributors, agents or affiliates, to Client or any party claiming by or through Client for any cause whatsoever exceed $100 (A.U.), regardless of the form of action and whether in contract, statute, tort or otherwise.<br />
<br />
7. TERMINATION<br />
7.1 Without Cause. This Agreement may be terminated by either party at any time during any Renewal Term for any or no reason upon either party giving to the other no less than five (5) days' prior written notice of termination. No matter which party terminates the Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1, any and all payment obligations of Client under this Agreement for Service(s) provided through the date of termination will immediately become due, and Client shall be required to prepay for any portion of the Services that have not been paid for and are to be rendered during such five (5) day period.<br />

In addition to any other rights it may have under this Agreement or applicable law, Manic Yak may immediately terminate this Agreement or suspend service, effective without notice, in the event of (i) a default in payment, or (ii) Client's breach or failure to comply with the TOS or AUP or other policies of Manic Yak.
